# Installation
Assuming that you are all [set up with a Julia and Jupyter](#Setting-Up-Julia-and-Jupyter-Notebooks), it is easy to install HarmonicBalance.jl, as we are registered in the Julia General registry. 
You can simply run the following command in the Julia REPL:
```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("HarmonicBalance")
```
or 
```julia
julia> ] # `]` should be pressed
julia> Pkg.add("HarmonicBalance")
```
You can check which version you have installled with the command 
```julia
julia> ]
julia> status HarmonicBalance
```

# Getting Started

Let us find the steady states of an external driven Duffing oscillator with nonlinear damping. Its equation of motion is:
```math
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\ddot{x}(t) + \gamma \dot{x}(t) + \omega_0^2 x(t)}_{\text{damped harmonic oscillator}} + \underbrace{\alpha x(t)^3}_{\text{Duffing coefficient}} = \underbrace{F \cos(\omega t)}_{\text{periodic drive}}
\end{equation}
```

```@example getting_started
using HarmonicBalance
@variables α ω ω0 F t η x(t) # declare constant variables and a function x(t)
eom = d(x,t,2) + ω0^2*x + α*x^3 + η*d(x,t)*x^2 ~ F*cos(ω*t)
diff_eq = DifferentialEquation(eom, x)
add_harmonic!(diff_eq, x, ω) # specify the ansatz x = u(T) cos(ωt) + v(T) sin(ωt)

# implement ansatz to get harmonic equations
harmonic_eq = get_harmonic_equations(diff_eq)

fixed = (α => 1.0, ω0 => 1.0, F => 0.01, η => 0.1)   # fixed parameters
varied = ω => range(0.9, 1.2, 100)           # range of parameter values
result = get_steady_states(harmonic_eq, varied, fixed)
```
The obtained steady states can be plotted as a function of the driving frequency:
```@example getting_started
plot(result, "sqrt(u1^2 + v1^2)")
```

# Setting Up Julia and Jupyter Notebooks

To ensure a smooth experience with our package, please follow these steps to set up Julia and Jupyter notebooks. Once these steps are completed, you can proceed to install and use our package seamlessly.

1.  **Download Julia**: Visit the [Julia Downloads page](https://julialang.org) and download the latest stable release for your operating system.
2.  **Install Julia**: Follow the installation instructions for your platform:
3.  Open Julia and enter the package manager by typing `]` in the Julia REPL.
4.  Add the `IJulia` package, which integrates Julia with Jupyter:
   ```julia
   add IJulia
   ```
5.  Once installed, `IJulia` will automatically set up Julia as a Jupyter kernel.
