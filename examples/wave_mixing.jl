# ## Three wave mixing

# If we only have a cubic nonlineariy $\alpha$, we observe the normal duffing oscillator
# response with no response at $2\omega$.

# We would like to investigate the three-wave mixing of the driven Duffing oscillator. This means we can excite the system resonantly if the oscillation frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ fullfil the conditions $\omega_1\pm\omega_2=\pm\omega_0$. Here, we will especially focus on the degenerate three wave mixing, where $\omega_2=\omega_0$ such that $2\omega_0=\omega_1$. This is a very important process in quantum optics, since it allows us to generate photons with a frequency in the visible range from photons with a frequency in the infrared range. This is called frequency doubling and is used in many applications, e.g. in laser pointers.
